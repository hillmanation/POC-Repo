### Config Management

This folder will be used for various configuration managment script examples for environments where dedicated config management tools (like Ansible) do not exist.

#### Planned Items

_Database config managment (In MariaDB, Cassandra, MySQL, etc)_  
_OS level config managment (Like FIPs settings, SELinux, Windows Registry, etc)_  
_Overall config management using a hashtable of desired settings (VMWare's STIG scripts represent this well)_  
_Post product/application install config management_  
_Any repeatable configuration operation_  
_Create a suite of Container based utilities to combine deployment and configuration utilities for automated complex application deployment (For engineering applications like Cameo or even automating entire multinode HPC/PBS based deployments)_
